# DMA & Recursion Practice (C, CS1)

This workspace contains graded-difficulty tasks to master **dynamic memory allocation (DMA)** and **recursion** in C.

## Layout
- Tiers: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced / Expert.
- Each task folder has: minimal README, source files, and tests.
- See **PROJECTS.md** for the index of tasks.

## Build / Run (typical)

## Global Rules
- No VLAs, no globals; standard C library only.
- Pair every successful malloc/realloc with a free.
- On allocation failure: clean up and exit non-zero or return NULL as specified.
- Keep I/O formatting exactly as the task requires.
